> GitHub Action to publish markdown files as articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to) platform, with assets hosted on GitHub.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Publish articles on dev.to
  uses: sinedied/a11y-ai-action@v2
  with:
    # Your dev.to personal API key to publish and update articles.
    # See https://docs.dev.to/api/#section/Authentication/api_key
    devto_key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_TOKEN }}
    # Your GitHub personal access token, used to create commits for updated files.
    # If you have a protected branch, you need to use a personal access token
    # with the 'repo' permission.
    # See https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # (Optional) The files to publish. Default is "posts/**/*.md"
    files: 'posts/**/*.md'
    # (Optional) The git branch to use. Default is 'main'.
    branch: main
    # (Optional) Use conventional commit messages. Default is false.
    # See https://www.conventionalcommits.org. 
    conventional_commits: true
    # (Optional) Do not make actual changes on dev.to.
    dry_run: false
```

You can use [this template repository](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-github-template) as an example setup.

## Using a custom committer

You can specify who you want to appear in the commits made by this action by adding these environment variables to the action:

```yaml
  env:
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: your_name
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: your@email.com
````

## How does it work?

This github action delegates most of the work to the [devto-cli](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-cli) push command.

You can find more information about how it works in the [CLI readme](https://github.com/sinedied/devto-cli).
